# Happy-Birthday-AR
3D augmented reality experience made with Spark AR and JavaScript

## Inspiration
What’s a good way to be there for someone’s special occasion without actually being there? By sending them an AR cake customized just for them of course. Especially during this Covid-19 pandemic, we’re all so far away from some of our closest people. It would be amazing to have something that would bind us all together, and to light up the face of your loved one. A customized AR cake seemed like the perfect way to do so with the feature of adding media from your gallery making it an amazing, sweet and thoughtful way to celebrate. "I sure can’t wait to have someone send me my AR cake!"

## What it does
Birthday Cake BakAR is a World Effect AR filter that allows you to choose a birthday cake with the bonus feature of adding a personal media from your gallery - something close to your heart. This is a personalized message to a loved one for their birthday or possibly even for other occasions that would be perfect with a cake. Melt your loved ones’ heart by lighting a candle and choosing a lovely AR cake for them to have. Once you light off the candle, a happy birthday song along with some balloons and confetti will fly over.

## How I built it
The filter was built in Spark AR Studio, I used javascript to create the UI Picker with a selection of cake options, and used the Patch editor to control the screen interaction for cake size, cake position, tap to light up candle, and tap the candle flame to light off the candle.

To make the celebration effect more personalized, I added the gallery texture and gallery picker for user to upload a media from their camera gallery.

Celebration must comes with a surprised, so I used Patch editor to create animation transition for the balloons and confetti flying over in the environment along with a Happy Birthday song.

All 3D models were used from Spark AR library.

## Challenges I ran into
Setting up the world effect confetti and balloons to fly to the correct angle for the camera view was challenging, lots of trial and error to make it working.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Learned Spark AR Studio to create AR effects in a very short period of time, consider no one in our team has experience working with Spark AR before, and be able to bring our vision to a working AR filter is one thing I am proud of.

## What I learned
I learned a lot about creating AR effects In Spark AR Studio.
